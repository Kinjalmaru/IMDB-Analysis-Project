# IMDB Project

Analyze IDMB data set from Kaggle.com to understand behaviors of different genres.

## Data cleanup and analysis

Explore, clean, and reformat the data before answering the problems. The exploration and cleanup steps are tracked in a dedicated Jupyter Notebook to make it easier to present our work later.

Similarly, after massaging our data and crunching numbers, we kept track of our work in a Jupyter Notebook dedicated specifically to analysis.


## Project Proposal

* Data set: IDMB

* Data source: Kaggle.com

* Problems: Analyze the data set and identify key metrics to understand the world of movie genres.

* Tools: Jupyter, Excel

## Presentation

After analyzing our data, we created visualizations to put our data in a presentable format.
