# IMDB Project

Analyze IDMB data set from Kaggle.com to understand behaviors of different genres.

## Data cleanup and analysis

Explore, clean, and reformat the data before answering the problems. The exploration and cleanup steps are tracked in a dedicated Jupyter Notebook to make it easier to present our work later.

Similarly, after massaging our data and crunching numbers, we kept track of our work in a Jupyter Notebook dedicated specifically to analysis.

## Team Effort

Before anything, remember that Projects are a **group effort**: Working closely with your teammates is a requirement. This both helps teach real-world collaborative workflows, and enables you to tackle more difficult problems than you'd be able to working alone.

In other words, working in groups allows you to **work smart** and **dream big**. Take advantage of it!
